## Description

This application is a command line app that allows for easy manouvering and manipulation of an employee database. 

It allows the user to update employee statuses and roles through an easy to follow inquirer prompt. 

The user can simply follow the prompts to view, add, and update employee roles and responsibilities.

Through this task, I learned the importance of understanding how to correctly join two tables to display the required information. For example, showing department names as opposed to department IDs that have little to no significance to the layperson.

## Installation

Before running node server.js, the user must run npm install and run the sql files through mysql.

## Usage

Upon initializing the application, the user is prompted to select an action from a dropdown menu. The menu lists options for viewing departments, roles, and employees, as well as options for adding new employees, roles, and departments.

The final two options are updating an existing employee's role and exiting the application altogether. After each option is selected, the menu repopulates. It also includes hints as to what to select to see the successful addition or update to the table.
